## Advent Setup

### Using Powershell in December

Running `./tomorrow.ps1` creates new python files for the following day, and a download script for the <b>current</b> day. (Run `tomorrow.ps1` before midnight and `download.ps1` after midnight)

Running `./init.ps1 [day]` creates new python files and downloads inputs for the specified day. Defaults to the current day.

### Using Powershell outside of December

Running `./init.ps1 <day> <year>` creates new python files and downloads inputs for the specified day.

### Using Python3

Running `python3 new_day.py <day> <year>` creates new python files for the specified day. 

Running `python3 download_input.py <day> <year>` will download the test input for the specified day.
